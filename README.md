# Types

Type definitions for the Scratch runtime.

The hope is to make it easier to develop reliable third-party tools.

## Scope

The goal is not necessarily to have in-depth descriptions of every function, but to at least have type information for the most commonly used methods.

Things we want to document in the near future:

 - scratch-vm
 - scratch-render
 - sb3 project.json

Things we want to document eventually, but lower priority:

 - scratch-blocks
 - scratch-storage
 - scratch-audio
 - scratch-parser?
 - scratch-svg-render?
 - scratch-sb1-converter?
 - scratch-render-fonts?
 - TurboWarp

Things that are out of scope:

 - scratch-paint
 - scratch-gui
 - scratch-www
 - scratch-l10n
 - api.scratch.mit.edu

## Tests

There are some tests in the tests folder. These files are never actually run, but the code will be type checked.

## License

Type definitions are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

The projects being documented may be licensed under different licenses.
